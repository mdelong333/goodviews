Project Description

- In this project we have created an application similar to the popular website "Goodreads." Instead of using books, we chose to use movies. The home page has a modal with movies for scrolling. On the Browse page, the user has the option to search for a movie or leaf through new releases, drama, action, horror and comedy. Once a movie is searched the poster, title, release date, plot and rating will come up. The user also has the option to favorite the movie. Once a movie is favorited it will appear in the My Titles page. We were able to get movie information by using the OMDb and TMDb APIs. Overall, our group did a nice job working collaboratevly.
